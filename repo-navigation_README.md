The Cs-371 Team Project repo has a main folder,scratch, that is the project root folder.
Inside the scratch root folder is our visual studio solutions file and the scratch files.
Within the scratch files is our visual studio/monogame libraries and further folders.
The content folder holds our icon images for the sprites as well as sound clips and other visual objects.
The scr holds our source code for the classes of the game.
And the x86/x64 holds our builds for the exe file.
