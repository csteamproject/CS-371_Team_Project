The Cs-371 Team Project repo has a main folder,scratch, that is the project root folder.
Inside the scratch root folder is our visual studio solutions file and the scratch files.
Within the scratch files is our visual studio/monogame libraries and further folders.
The content folder holds our icon images for the sprites as well as sound clips and other visual objects.
The scr holds our source code for the classes of the game.
And the x86/x64 holds our builds for the exe file.

If you would just like to play our game, download the Release folder and run the Scratch.exe file


In our src file is our class files and they will be contained in folders per content they cover.


To use the code we have developed here, you must first install MonoGame which can be found here: http://www.monogame.net/
and it would be helpful to use visual studio if on a microsoft machine. If not on a Microsoft machine, our project will still fully
work in the MonoGame IDE. 

Once MonoGame is installed, and the repo is cloned, navigate to the .sln file to open our projects solution in the IDE of your choosing (either MonoGame or VisualStudio) to use the game in debug or to modify the codes. Otherwise navigate to the x86/x64 file and then to release to find our Scratch.exe that will run in Windows.

To play the game either hit start in the MonoGame IDE or run in VisualStudio.

All supporting files and documents when pulled from this repo are usable at run time, no further installations required.

For further development questions or bug reports post on the Discord Chat.
