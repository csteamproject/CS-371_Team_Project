Software Architecture Document (SAD) for Map classes and functions


System Overview: 
	
	Introduction to the system and a description of its usage and
	key functions.

	The map system is an isometric map designed to be the main and only map of the game. The system also handles the light aura around the player. It is comprised of 4 classes, a sprite sheet, and 1 light aura image.


Views:

	Information about the systems overall design structure. Also document how the
	views relate to each other in this system. Each view is summarized with its
	main elements and interactions. Don't include the technical details in this
	section.



	


Software Units:

	Include a complete catalogue of the software units to be developed. Include
	precise specifications and interfaces and note all of the views where the
	unit appears.


Analysis Data and Results:
	
	This section contains details about the architecture in the system, computing
	resources and execution environment so a design analyst can measure the
	quality attributes. Results are also recorded here.

	
Design Rationale:
	
	Explain your design decisions here and defend why you chose them. Reason for
	doing so is that when someone revisits the code, if it's programmed a
	specific way then it is clearly indicated as to why.

	


Definitions, Glossary, Acronyms:

	Don't assume your reader knows everything you're talking about. Clearly
	define it here.

	light aura - the circle of visibility around the player, the rest is dimmed to simulate darkness around the player. 

	sprite sheet - a sheet with different "images" that are used in the map (trees, rocks, etc.)
